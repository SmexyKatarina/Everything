                        The first four buttons in order, will have these icons except for the last one. It will have a number written on it that will change over time.

                        <li>Clicking on one of the four buttons that have the icons will place its respective objects upon the empty panel showing information for it's respective module in the list below.</li>
                        <li>If a panel is already solved (green coloring), it means that there is still information you have to gather from it <strong>BUT</strong> there is nothing to be interacted with to get your digit.</li>
                        <li>Each of the four buttons with icons will give a digit. <strong>Make sure that you have not when into the final phase without getting this information as it will not give you a free way out in order to check.</strong></li>
                        <li>The four digits are obtain by their respective manuals below. This four-digit number will be used for the final panel and will be referred to as <strong>FF</strong> (short for, Final Four).</li>
                        <li><strong>If you strike on the final panel, the other panels will open back up and will be allowed to switch between all five of them.</strong></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If the rule refers to the color of the wire, ignore the color condition and cut the wire it refers to. (e.g. "Cut the last blue wire" actually means "Cut the last wire")</li>
                        <li>If the rule refers to an edgework condition, the edgework condition must be true in order to cut that wire. If the edgework condition is not true, proceed to the next rule in order.</li>

                    <p>This final panel will be solved like a normal Wire Sequences module, however there are offsets to the cut tables that need to be calculated.</p>
                    <p>To calculate the true offset for each of the tables do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Red Table</strong>: Take the first digit of the <strong>FF</strong> and add it to the fourth digit of the <strong>FF</strong>. Take this modulo 10 and add one. This is the true offset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blue Table:</strong> Take the second digit of the <strong>FF</strong> and add it to the fourth digit of the <strong>FF</strong>. Take this modulo 10 and add one. This is the true offset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Black Table</strong>: Take the third digit of the <strong>FF</strong> and add it to the fourth digit of the <strong>FF</strong>. Take this modulo 10 and add one. This is the true offset.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using these offsets on their respective tables, go down that many rows in the table starting from "First Occurrence" and that is your <strong>Starting row</strong> or your "First Occurrence".</p>
                    <p>Solve the panel as you would normally solve a Wire Sequences. If you happen to reach the end of the table, wrap around back to the top and continue.</p>
                    <p>Trying to go back or to the next panel while wires still need to be cut, will result in a strike. Cutting an incorrect wire will result in a strike.</p>
                    <p>Once all correct wires have been cut, the module will solve.</p>
